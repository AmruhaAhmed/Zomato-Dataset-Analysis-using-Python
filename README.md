# Zomato-Dataset-Analysis-using-Python

Two datasets have been used to analyze the different restaurants and cuisines available on Zomato :

1. Zomato

2.Country-Code

These datasets have been obtained from the public domain.

I have used pandas library for data pre-processing and matplotlib,seaborn,plotly and pywaffle libraries for data visualization using Python language.
